# ⚔️ RPG Task Slayer
**Turning daily disorganization into a Level-Up experience.**

## 📋 Project Overview
RPG Task Slayer is a gamified productivity app built to help users manage fitness goals and daily tasks. By treating real-life chores as "Quests," users earn XP, level up, and manage their "Quest Log" in a dynamic, reactive interface.

This project was built to master **React State Management**, **Array Manipulation (CRUD)**, and **Dynamic Logic**.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* **Framework:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (via Vite)
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** Custom CSS / Inline Styles
* **Environment:** GitHub Codespaces

## 🚀 Features (Current Progress)
- [x] **Leveling System:** Track player level and experience points.
- [x] **Dynamic XP Curve:** Difficulty increases by 50% every time the user levels up.
- [x] **Quest Log:** Add custom tasks (Fitness, Gaming, etc.) to an array-based list.
- [x] **Real-time Updates:** Completion of tasks instantly grants XP and updates the UI.
- [x] **Task Removal:** Quests are filtered out of the list upon completion.

## 🧠 Coding Concepts Mastered
* `useState`: Managing numbers (XP), strings (Input), and arrays (Quests).
* **The Spread Operator (`...`)**: Copying and updating arrays without mutating data.
* **Array Methods (`.map`, `.filter`)**: Rendering lists of data and removing specific items by ID.
* **Conditional Logic**: Calculating Level-Ups based on dynamic variables.

## 📈 Future Quests (Roadmap)
- [ ] **Persistence:** Add `localStorage` to save progress after browser refresh.
- [ ] **Character Stats:** Add Strength (for fitness tasks) and Intelligence (for coding tasks).
- [ ] **Animations:** CSS transitions for the XP bar filling up.
